This program takes in a ANALYZE header file linked to a image file, scales the image, and creates a new header file for the new scaled image. 

To run the program with custom arguments.
./ass5 [source_hdr] [output_hdr] [scale_factor]

For example:
./ass5 stripped.hdr stripped-5.hdr .5
stripped.hdr: source hdr file
stripped-5.hdr: output hdr file
.5: scale factor(reduce image by factor of 2x)
